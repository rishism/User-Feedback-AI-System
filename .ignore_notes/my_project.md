# Project: Intelligent User Feedback Analysis and Action System

## Business Problem

Modern SaaS and app-based companies receive **dozens of user reviews and feedback daily** from multiple channels including app stores (Google Play, App Store), customer support emails, and user surveys. The current **manual triaging process** is slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale effectively resulting in critical bugs being missed, feature requests being delayed, and inconsistent prioritization across teams.

## Scenario

You are a product engineer at a B2C mobile app company that manages a productivity app with around 10,000 active users. Your team currently receives:

*   10-20 app store reviews daily
*   5-10 customer support emails per day
*   Occasional in-app feedback submissions

A team member manually reads through this feedback and creates tickets in your project management system. This process takes 1-2 hours daily and often results in:

*   Delayed response to critical bugs
*   Inconsistent ticket formatting and prioritization
*   Lost or overlooked feedback
*   Poor traceability from user complaint to engineering resolution

## Your Task: Complete Project Implementation

Design, implement, and demonstrate a **complete multi-agent AI system** that:

1.  **Reads** user feedback from CSV files containing app store reviews and support emails
2.  **Classifies** content into categories (Bug / Feature Request / Praise / Complaint / Spam)
3.  **Extracts** actionable insights and technical details
4.  **Creates** structured tickets and logs them to CSV files with appropriate priority levels and metadata
5.  **Ensures** quality and consistency through automated review
6.  **Provides** a user interface for monitoring and manual overrides

## System Objectives

Your complete system should achieve:

*   **Automation**: Process feedback from CSV files without manual intervention
*   **Speed**: Complete analysis and ticket creation within minutes
*   **Consistency**: Standardize ticket format and priority assignment
*   **Traceability**: Maintain clear links from original feedback to generated tickets
*   **Usability**: Provide an intuitive interface for monitoring and control

## Multi-Agent Architecture to Implement

| Agent | Primary Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CSV Reader Agent** | Reads and parses feedback data from CSV files |
| **Feedback Classifier Agent** | Categorizes feedback using NLP (bug, feature request, praise, complaint, spam) |
| **Bug Analysis Agent** | Extracts technical details: steps to reproduce, platform info, severity assessment |
| **Feature Extractor Agent** | Identifies feature requests and estimates user impact/demand |
| **Ticket Creator Agent** | Generates structured tickets and logs them to output CSV files |
| **Quality Critic Agent** | Reviews generated tickets for completeness and accuracy |

## Technical Implementation Requirements

*   **Framework**: CrewAI or AutoGen for agent orchestration
*   **UI**: Streamlit for monitoring and manual overrides
*   **Input**: Read from CSV files containing mock feedback data
*   **Output**: Log generated tickets to CSV files for offline analysis
*   **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
*   **Configuration**: Configurable parameters for classification thresholds and priorities

## Step 1: Create Mock Dataset CSV Files

First, create the following CSV files with realistic sample data:

### 1. app_store_reviews.csv

**Columns**: `review_id`, `platform`, `rating`, `review_text`, `user_name`, `date`, `app_version`

**Hints**:

*   **Bug examples**: "App crashes when I...", "Can't login since update", "Data sync not working"
*   **Feature requests**: "Please add...", "Would love to see...", "Missing functionality..."
*   **Praise**: "Amazing app!", "Love the new feature", "Works perfectly"
*   **Complaints**: "Too expensive", "Poor customer service", "App is slow"
*   **Spam**: Promotional text, random characters, unrelated content
*   **Mix platforms**: Include both "Google Play" and "App Store"
*   **Vary ratings**: 1-5 stars, with bugs typically 1-2, features 3-4, praise 4-5
*   **Realistic versions**: "2.1.3", "3.0.1", etc.

### 2. support_emails.csv

**Columns**: `email_id`, `subject`, `body`, `sender_email`, `timestamp`, `priority`

**Hints**:

*   **Bug subjects**: "App Crash Report", "Login Issue", "Data Loss Problem"
*   **Feature subjects**: "Feature Request: Dark Mode", "Suggestion for Improvement"
*   **Include technical details**: Device models, OS versions, steps to reproduce
*   **Vary email styles**: Formal business emails vs casual user messages
*   **Include timestamps**: Recent dates in various formats
*   **Priority levels**: Leave some blank, others with "High", "Medium", "Low"

### 3. expected_classifications.csv

**Columns**: `source_id`, `source_type`, `category`, `priority`, `technical_details`, `suggested_title`

**Hints**:

*   **Map to your reviews/emails**: Use same IDs from above files
*   **Categories**: Bug, Feature Request, Praise, Complaint, Spam
*   **Priorities**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
*   **Technical details**: For bugs, include device info, reproduction steps
*   **Suggested titles**: Clear, actionable ticket titles

## Step 2: System Implementation

Implement the complete multi-agent system including:

**Core Components**:

1.  **Agent Classes**: Implement each agent with specific responsibilities
2.  **Data Processing Pipeline**: CSV reading, processing, and output generation
3.  **Classification Logic**: NLP-based categorization with confidence scores
4.  **Ticket Generation**: Structured output with proper formatting
5.  **Quality Control**: Validation and review mechanisms

**User Interface**:

*   **Dashboard**: Overview of processed feedback and generated tickets
*   **Configuration Panel**: Adjust classification thresholds and priorities
*   **Manual Override**: Edit or approve generated tickets
*   **Analytics**: Show processing statistics and performance metrics

**Output Files**:

*   **generated_tickets.csv**: Final ticket output with proper structure
*   **processing_log.csv**: Detailed processing history and decisions
*   **metrics.csv**: Performance and accuracy metrics

## Step 3: Demonstration and Testing

Create a complete demo showing:

1.  **Data ingestion** from your mock CSV files
2.  **Real-time processing** with agent interactions
3.  **Classification accuracy** compared to expected results
4.  **Ticket generation** with proper formatting
5.  **User interface** functionality and monitoring
6.  **Error handling** and edge case management
